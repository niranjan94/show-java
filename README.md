## About
This is a Decompiler that extracts the source code of an Android application (including XML files and image assets). Works directly from your android device.

## Features

- Select either **CFR 0.110**, **JaDX 0.6.1** or **FernFlower (analytical decompiler)** to use as the decompiler (more to come).
- Runs directly on an android device (4.x and above).
- Select apk from sdcard (or) from a list of installed applications.
- Easy to use.
- Decompiles resources too (layouts, Drawables, Menus, AndroidManifest, image assets).
- Displays code in a clean-syntax-highlighted form.
- The decompiled source can easily be copied from the sdcard (source is stored in ShowJava folder in the sdcard).
- Simple source browser with a summary of all decompilation errors.
- Each decompiled source file has commented references to classes that could not be decompiled.
- Share the decompiled source easily with the built in archive + share mechanism.

## Known Issues
1. Does not work with system applications in most of the phones (especially ones that are not de-odexed).
2. Slow on phones with single core processors.
