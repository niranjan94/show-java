## Contributing to ShowJava

1. Fork the repository. ([niranjan94/show-java](https://www.github.com/niranjan94/show-java))
2. Clone the repository locally by using the command: ```git clone git@github.com:username/show-java```

> Connect your local to the original ‘upstream’ repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from ‘upstream’ often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. See more detailed instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork).

3. Create a branch for your edits/bugfixes/feature additions
4. Do your magic
5. Test whatever you made in Android versions 4.0.x , 4.4.x, 5.x
6. Once you're confident in your code, send a pull request to the master branch of the upstream repository with a proper descriptions explaining what you did and why. Be clear and consise.
7. Wait for one of the project maintainers to review your pull request.
8. We may merge it into the master branch if it's good. 

> Also have a look at the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), to understand better how all this works.

## Reporting a Bug ([over here](https://github.com/niranjan94/show-java/issues/new))

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/niranjan94/show-java/issues) for your issue. Duplicating an issue is slower for both parties so search through open and closed issues to see if what you’re running into has been addressed already.
2. Be clear about what your problem is: what was the expected outcome, what happened instead? Detail how someone else can recreate the problem.
3. Include system details like Android version, total RAM, etc.
4. If possible, include the link to the app that you were trying to decompile
5. Paste stacktrace (if possible) in your issue or in a Gist. If pasting them in the issue, wrap it in three backticks: <code>```</code> so that it renders nicely.
6. Submit it and wait for one of the project maintainers to review it. (Please be patient)
